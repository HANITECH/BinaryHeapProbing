Description:
----------- 
This program will build a Binary Heap from an initial collections of items using a file with a complete path or directly from user entries 
using command line window.While building the Binary Heap - Using insert()-, the program will save each node location into
a hash table -a quadratic linear probing is used for hashing nodes locations.
The Hash Table is updated on every insertion , deletion , increasekey ,and  decreasekey operations.

Time Complexity Analysis:
-----------------------
Building the Heap :insertion for one item is O(1) on average and O(log N) for worst case.For N items, O(N) in average and O(N log N) for worst case.
Finding a Node   : Because we use a hash table to store nodes locations, it will take a constant time O(1) to find one node,making the operation cheap.
                   As a result, other operations that use findlocation() will be cheap as well.

 
Important Functions :
-------------------
******************PUBLIC OPERATIONS*********************
 void insert( x )                    --> Insert x ( a node ) into the heap
 deleteMin( minItem )                --> Remove (and optionally return) smallest item
 Comparable findMin( )               --> Return smallest item
 bool isEmpty( )                     --> Return true if empty; else false
 void makeEmpty( )                   --> Remove all items 
 void increaseKey(delta,key)         --> Increases delta value then percolate down 
 void decreaseKey(delta,key)         --> Decreases delta value then percolate up
 void removeKey(key)                 --> Assigning a minimum key value, Percolate up till root then delete

Compiling Instructions:
----------------------
                      	#cmake CMakeLists.txt
			            make
Running Instructions: 
--------------------- 
From a file containing data: Redirect the input file  as follows  ./335_4 < input.txt
From command line window   : after make file is run, input all the data needed to build the binary heap then type "end" and press enter key.
                             to remove some data; type the all the data needed to be removed then type " end " and press enter key.
